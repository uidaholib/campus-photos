# University of Idaho Administration Building
{:.pb-3}

The University of Idaho exemplifies the essence of a traditional university atmosphere. Surrounded by the rolling fields of the Palouse, historic lecture halls, student residences, and Greek organizations stands the Administration Building, an icon of the university’s history. Today students and faculty traverse the halls and ponder the many historic photographs, yet many do not know the history of this iconic building.

To the surprise of many, the current administration building stands in the place of the “old admin” building, which served as the center of campus during the University’s earliest years. Built in 1982, the original administration building featured three stories, a basement, a centralized steeple, and three wings which housed many classrooms as well as the university library. 

After several years of use, the old administration building caught fire in the early hours of the morning on March 30, 1906. Despite the intensity of the flames, faculty and students worked together to recover many items from the burning building. As Dean of Faculty Jay Eldridge was saving important university documents many students worked to save a stuffed mountain goat and several other objects.

One of the most prized items saved from the fire was the “Silver and Gold Book.” This object is a book-shaped box made completely of precious metals and gems mined in Idaho. The center design is an engraved image of the old administration building and the surrounding designs depict major Idahoan industries such as mining, agriculture, and so forth. Very few treasures were recovered before the building collapsed, however a portion of the rubble was collected and used to build the memorial steps which still stand today.

Following the fire, classes and other university functions were relocated to buildings on and off campus. Construction of a new administration building began soon, and three years later marked the completion of the main wing of the new and improved administration building. Following the completion of the main wing in 1909, the North Wing was completed in 1912 and the South Wing, South Wing library, and South Wing elevator were completed in 1912, 1920, 1937, and 2000, respectively.

Since the foundation of the University, the old and new administration buildings and surrounding areas have been home to many traditions. In the early 1900s a fountain in front of the administration entrance saw many upperclassmen facilitating the “dunking of the frosh,” a tradition in which upperclassmen would “initiate” freshmen into the university by making them swim in the fountain. 

Over time the traditions have changed and grown to embody the spirit of the University of Idaho. For example, each year the freshman class is led by the university President, marching band, and other groups through campus to the administration lawn where they enjoy a picnic with their peers, professors, and advisers. Years later, those who graduate are led once more from the administration building to their commencement, representing the full circle of their time at the University of Idaho. The administration building is an icon of the University of Idaho, but moreover it represents our rich history and embodies the spirit of its students, staff, and alumni.
