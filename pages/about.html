        <h1>About the Campus Buildings Exhibit</h1>

        <p>This exhibit was inspired by the numerous photographs in University of Idaho's Digital Collections that depict the campus structure and culture throughout the 20th century. In July 2019, UI's <a href="https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning</a> (CDIL) undergraduate fellow Rylee Robertson set about retaking these photos so that the differences and similarities of the UI campus might be explored by alumni and current students alike. The resulting photos are displayed on this site using Northwestern University's Knight Lab tool <a href="https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/">JuxtaposeJS</a>, and the site was built using UI's own  <a href="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/">CollectionBuilder</a> platform.</p>

        <p>The images in this exhibit have been curated from <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/uihistorical/">The University of Idaho Historical Photos Collection</a>, <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/campus/">UI's Campus Photograph Collection</a>, <a href="https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/collection/pg2">The University of Idaho Student Organizations Collection</a>, and <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/troosevelt/index.html">The Theodore Roosevelt collection</a>.</p>
